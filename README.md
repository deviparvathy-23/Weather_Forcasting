### Project Description
This is a project which is used to determine the weather conditions of a particular city such as temperature, cloud description, region and provide necessary alerts for heatwaves and rain.

### The Problem statement
The current weather forecasting systems rely on complex models and large datasets, but they often struggle with accuracy and real-time updates. Users require an easy-to-use system that provides reliable weather predictions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation chances.

### The Solution
To develop a weather forecasting system that retrieves real-time weather data using an API (such as OpenWeatherMap) and presents it in a user-friendly interface. The system should allow users to input a location (city, zip code, or coordinates) and receive weather information in a structured format.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- HTML for structuring the web page.
- CSS for styling and layout.
- JavaScript for fetching and displaying weather data.
- OpenWeatherMap API for weather data retrieval.

# Installation
- Install Node.js (if not already installed):
    Download and install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/.
- Use the Live Server extension in VS Code or install a lightweight server via npm

# Project Documentation
## Features
- Fetches real-time weather data using OpenWeatherMap API.
- Determines if the region is a plain or hilly area based on sea level and ground level.
- Displays temperature and weather description.
- Provides weather alerts for heat waves and rain chances.
- Responsive UI with a background image and user-friendly design

## Possible enhancements
- Improving UI: Adding animations and a better design.
- 5-Day Forecast: Fetching multiple days of weather data.
- Geolocation Support: Fetching weather based on the user's current location.
- Machine Learning: Implementing predictive models for more accurate forecasts.
 ## Conclusions
 This Weather App provides real-time weather updates with region classification and alert mechanisms. It utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API for data retrieval and dynamically displays weather information based on user input. The app can be further enhanced with additional features like forecasts and geolocation support.
